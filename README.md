# Adult-Income-Data
Objective:

The main objective of the dataset is to classify people earning <=50k or >50k based on several explanatory factors affecting the income of a person like Age, Occupation, Education, etc.

A person's annual income depends on many factors. Visually, it is influenced by the person's education level, age, gender, occupation, etc. 

This is a frequently cited Logistic Regression dataset. I encountered this during my course. This is a good entry-level example of data preprocessing and machine learning, so I'd like to share it here.

The dataset contains 15 columns : They are

1)  age
2)  workclass
3)  fnlwgt
4)  education
5)  education-num
6)  marital-status
7)  occupation
8)  relationship	
9)  race	
10) sex	
11) capital-gain	
12) capital-loss	
13) hours-per-week	
14) native-country	
15) salary

The Targeted field is "salary"
The salary is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K
And all the remaining 14 attributes are the demographics and these features are used to describe a person

We can explore the possibility in predicting salary/income level based on the individualâ€™s personal information.
